# Kirk's Unhackable password Creator

## Description

In this repository you will find the code containing a random password generator webpage. The Purpose of this was to excercise and demonstrate my gowing knowledge and skills using JavaScript.

A few of the starting points were provided by the webpage template, some of which I kept, and a few I changed to better suit my idea. Hopefully the comments are enlightening as to my methods and thought process.

Please enjoy!

## Usage

To interact with the webpage, click on the Generate Password button to receive a series of prompts. These prompts will allow users to construct the parameters of their generated password.
