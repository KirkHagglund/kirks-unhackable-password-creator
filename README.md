# Kirk's Unhackable password Creator

## Description

In this repository you will find the code containing a random password generator webpage. The Purpose of this was to excercise and demonstrate my gowing knowledge and skills using JavaScript.

A few of the starting points were provided by the webpage template, some of which I kept, and a few I changed to better suit my idea. Hopefully the comments are enlightening as to my methods and thought process.

Please enjoy!

## Usage

To interact with the webpage, click on the Generate Password button to receive a series of prompts. These prompts will allow users to construct the parameters of their generated password.

## Credits

To build the JavaScript portion of this website, I took full advantage of Ask BCS as well as the tutors scheduled through Team Calendly. Their assistance was crucial in helping me turn my ideas into practicable solutions. Thanks as well are owed to classmate Michael Frayne, who got me started with the idea for separate arrays containing character types.
